# NBA Data API

## Purpose
For a lot of different projects, I find myself needing NBA box score data (estimating daily fantasy sports performance, for example). This project currently tries to capture box score data found on [basketball-reference.com](http://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/dailyleaders.cgi?lid=header_dateoutput&month=01&day=02&year=2016) and create queryable API endpoints for public consumption.

## API
Here's a sample of what the box score API endpoint looks like ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/4Ipx4LL.png)
